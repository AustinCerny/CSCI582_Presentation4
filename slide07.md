# AWS Introduction (V)
*** 
#### _Scalabily_ An Extreme Example

* NASA employs AWS to help control the Mars Rovers
	* 60 minute communication buffer between Earth and Mars
	* Huge amount of computation needed after message is received
	* After sending a message no computation is needed at all for another hour
	* NASA's Jet Propulsion Labratory will use millions of virtual machines for minutes at a time to calculate the next commands to sending
		* 90%+ time reduction
	* Minimized time needed to calculate commands without needed to own/operate an expensive cluster
		* NASA is only charged of these massive resources during the short intervals they are used for
