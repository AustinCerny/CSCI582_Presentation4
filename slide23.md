# Summary

***
This is just an introduction to AWS, there are 50+ specialized services in total.
* Based on the degree to which AWS has grown and the sizeable amount of web traffic it controls it is at least worth knowing what AWS is and some of its basics
* Benfits associated with AWS are hard to ignore
	* Centralized hosting/computing of this variety is likely the future
* There are a wide variety of services offered by AWS, not just traditional web hosting
	* It is worth researching to see if there are features that can mitigate specific challenges/needs of a paticular software project

I would highly recommend checking out AWS free tier options
* You can basically have your own free server and never have to worry about uptime or security
