# AWS Introduction (IV)
*** 
#### What's so great about Amazon Web Services _Scalabily_

* AWS introduced revolutionary scalability feature to its users
	* Any future planning involving an organization IT/web hosting concerns no longer needed
	* Scaling is more or less instantaneous, no delays/problems when an organization grows
		* No need to worry about short term fluctuations in traffic.
		* Even large companies like Neflix have sharp increases/decreases in traffic throughout a 24 hr period
	* Different features (content filtering, active directories etc.) can added/removed when scaling
	* Costs/resource remain similar as a service is scaled
