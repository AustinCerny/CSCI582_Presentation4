*** 
* Instances of EC2 machines have their own hardware.
* Different Tiers have different charges

| Machine | CPU count | RAM |  
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| General Purpose Small |  1 | 2 Gb | 
| General Purpose Medium |  2 | 4 Gb | 
| General Purpose Large |  4 | 8 Gb | 
| Compute Optimized | 8-32 | 8 = 60 Gb |
| Memory Optimized | 2-16 | 32- 244 Gb |
| Storage Optimized |2-16 | 8 - 122 Gb (800 Gb SSD) |
| GPU Instances | 8-32 (100+ GPU cores) | 16-60 Gb |

* Core's clock speed will vary as well
	* Intel Xeon architecture (1.8 -2.6 - 3.6 GHz)
	* Cheaper rates for selecting 1.0-1.2 GHz AMD Opteron cores from 2007

* User can also "bid" on spot instances of EC2 which become available when AWS has unused resources
